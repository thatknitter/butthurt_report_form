# Butthurt Report Form

Do you have someone who always gets mad at things they read on the internet?

Do you know of someone who cannot stand that others have opinions? 

Send them the Butthurt Report Form so they can submit their problems and find out what we all really think: That no one really cares, multiple ways. 

Feel free to send me a pull request with any additional ways you can think of to tell people you don't care. Link to this on your blog. On a comment post.

I enjoy feedback so any ideas or issues you may have are welcome (also, if you notice a problem and you have a solution, I'm all ears).

Have a nice day, and don't let the butthurt ruin it!
